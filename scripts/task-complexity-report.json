      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the test coverage improvement task into specific subtasks addressing: 1) Current coverage analysis, 2) Fixing failing tests, 3) Improving mocking/stub logic, 4) Adding new tests for uncovered areas, 5) CI/CD pipeline configuration, and 6) Test code optimization. For each subtask, specify deliverables, acceptance criteria, and estimated effort.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical aspects including test analysis, code modification, mocking improvements, new test creation, CI/CD configuration, and code optimization. The cyclomatic complexity is high due to numerous decision paths in testing scenarios and the need to understand existing code structure. The task requires both analytical skills to identify coverage gaps and implementation skills to fix and enhance tests. The 6 recommended subtasks align with the 6 detailed points already outlined in the task description, each representing a distinct area of work with its own complexity factors."
