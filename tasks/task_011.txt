# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a robust error handling system for both frontend and backend operations.
# Details:
1. Create a centralized error handling utility for API requests.
2. Implement custom error classes for different types of errors (network, validation, etc.).
3. Add error boundaries to React components to catch and display runtime errors.
4. Create user-friendly error messages for common error scenarios.
5. Implement logging of errors to a backend service for monitoring.
6. Add retry logic for transient errors, especially in real-time connections.
7. Ensure all async operations are properly wrapped in try-catch blocks.
8. Create a global error state in Zustand for managing application-wide errors.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for error handling utilities. Create integration tests that simulate various error scenarios. Perform end-to-end tests to verify error messages are displayed correctly to users.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Custom Error Class Hierarchy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a hierarchy of custom error classes for different application layers
### Details:
Define base error classes for different application layers (DataAccessError, BusinessLogicError, PresentationError). Include properties for error codes, user-friendly messages, and technical details. Ensure errors can be serialized for logging and API responses.

## 2. Implement Centralized Error Handling Utility [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create a centralized error handling service for consistent error processing
### Details:
Develop a utility that processes all errors through a single pipeline. Include functionality for error transformation, logging, and appropriate response generation. Ensure the utility can be used across different services in a microservices architecture.

## 3. Set Up React Error Boundaries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement error boundaries at strategic levels in the React component tree
### Details:
Create error boundary components for critical UI sections and the root application. Design fallback UIs for different error scenarios. Ensure error boundaries capture component rendering errors and provide appropriate user feedback.

## 4. Develop User-Friendly Error Messaging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.3
### Description: Create a system for displaying appropriate error messages to users
### Details:
Design a component library for different types of error notifications (toasts, modals, inline messages). Map technical errors to user-friendly messages. Support different severity levels and provide actionable information when possible.

## 5. Implement Backend Error Logging Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Set up comprehensive error logging for backend services
### Details:
Configure structured logging for errors with contextual information. Implement log aggregation and search capabilities. Set up alerting for critical errors. Ensure sensitive information is properly redacted from logs.

## 6. Build Retry Logic for Network Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Implement resilient retry mechanisms for network requests
### Details:
Create a retry utility with exponential backoff for API calls and service communications. Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures. Add configurable retry policies for different types of operations.

## 7. Develop Async Error Handling Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Create patterns for handling errors in asynchronous code
### Details:
Implement error handling for Promises, async/await, and event handlers. Create utilities for wrapping async functions with consistent error handling. Ensure errors in async code are properly propagated to the centralized error system.

## 8. Implement Global Error State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3, 11.4, 11.7
### Description: Create a global error state management solution
### Details:
Set up a global error state using context or state management library. Implement hooks for components to access and update error state. Create mechanisms for clearing errors and tracking error resolution status.
