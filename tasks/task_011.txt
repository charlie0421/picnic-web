# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a robust error handling system for both frontend and backend operations.
# Details:
1. Create a centralized error handling utility for API requests.
2. Implement custom error classes for different types of errors (network, validation, etc.).
3. Add error boundaries to React components to catch and display runtime errors.
4. Create user-friendly error messages for common error scenarios.
5. Implement logging of errors to a backend service for monitoring.
6. Add retry logic for transient errors, especially in real-time connections.
7. Ensure all async operations are properly wrapped in try-catch blocks.
8. Create a global error state in Zustand for managing application-wide errors.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for error handling utilities. Create integration tests that simulate various error scenarios. Perform end-to-end tests to verify error messages are displayed correctly to users.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Centralized Error Utility Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a centralized error utility module to standardize error handling across the application. This module should include utility functions for error formatting, categorization, and propagation.
### Details:
Develop a TypeScript module in the shared utils directory. Ensure it can be imported both in frontend and backend code. Include functions for formatting error messages, mapping error codes, and optionally integrating with logging services.

## 2. Define and Implement Custom Error Classes [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop custom error classes (e.g., AuthError, ValidationError, ApiError) that extend the native Error object, providing additional context and metadata.
### Details:
Implement these classes in TypeScript, ensuring they are compatible with both server and client environments. Integrate them with the centralized error utility for consistent usage.

## 3. Integrate React Error Boundaries Using Next.js App Router [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Set up error boundaries at appropriate route segments using Next.js 13+ App Router conventions (error.js files) to catch and isolate errors in the UI.
### Details:
Create error.js files in relevant app route segments. Implement error boundary components that display user-friendly messages and provide recovery options (e.g., retry button). Ensure error boundaries report errors to the centralized utility.

## 4. Implement User-Facing Error Messaging Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Develop reusable UI components for displaying error messages to users, ensuring clarity and actionable feedback.
### Details:
Use Tailwind CSS to style error alerts, modals, or banners. Ensure messages are specific and helpful, avoiding generic text. Integrate with error boundaries and async error handlers.

## 5. Set Up Backend Error Logging and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Implement backend error logging using Supabase functions or third-party services. Ensure all critical errors are logged with sufficient context for debugging.
### Details:
Integrate logging in API routes and server actions. Optionally connect to external monitoring tools for alerting and analytics. Ensure logs include error type, stack trace, and user/session context where possible.

## 6. Add Retry Logic for Recoverable Errors [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.3
### Description: Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors (e.g., network failures) in both frontend data fetching and backend API calls.
### Details:
Use the reset function in error boundaries for UI retries. For async operations, implement exponential backoff or limited retries. Ensure retries are tracked and do not cause infinite loops.

## 7. Enhance Async Error Handling in Data Fetching and Actions [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.6
### Description: Standardize async error handling in React components, server actions, and API routes using the centralized utility and custom error classes.
### Details:
Refactor existing async code to use try/catch where appropriate, returning or throwing custom errors. Ensure all async errors are surfaced to error boundaries or logged as needed.

## 8. Implement Global Error State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.4, 11.7
### Description: Establish a global error state using React context or a state management library to track and respond to errors across the application.
### Details:
Create a context provider for error state. Allow components to set, clear, and subscribe to global errors. Integrate with error boundaries and user messaging components for seamless UX.
