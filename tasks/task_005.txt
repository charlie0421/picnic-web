# Task ID: 5
# Title: 서버 컴포넌트 데이터 페칭 구현
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor data fetching logic to use server components with the server Supabase client.
# Details:
1. Create utility functions for common data fetching operations using server Supabase client
2. Move data fetching from client components to server components
3. Implement proper error handling for server-side data fetching
4. Use React Suspense for loading states where appropriate

Example implementation:
```typescript
// app/posts/page.tsx
import { createServerSupabaseClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'

async function getPosts() {
  const supabase = createServerSupabaseClient()
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('posts')
    .select('*')
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching posts:', error)
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch posts')
  }
  
  return data
}

export default async function PostsPage() {
  const posts = await getPosts()
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(post => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for data fetching utility functions
2. Test error handling scenarios
3. Create integration tests that verify server components correctly fetch and render data
4. Mock Supabase responses for testing

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create server-side data fetching utility functions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop reusable utility functions for server-side data fetching using Supabase server client
### Details:
Create a set of utility functions that leverage the Supabase server client for data fetching. These functions should handle common data access patterns, support pagination, filtering, and sorting. Implement proper typing for all functions and ensure they're optimized for server component usage. Include documentation for each function explaining its purpose and usage patterns.

## 2. Implement error handling patterns for server components [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Design and implement consistent error handling patterns for server component data fetching
### Details:
Create error boundary components specifically designed for server components. Implement standardized error handling patterns including error logging, fallback UI components, and retry mechanisms. Ensure errors are properly typed and categorized (network errors, authentication errors, etc.). Develop a strategy for handling errors at different levels of the component tree.

## 3. Integrate React Suspense with server components [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Set up React Suspense boundaries and loading states for server component data fetching
### Details:
Implement Suspense boundaries at appropriate levels in the component hierarchy. Create loading UI components that provide meaningful feedback during data fetching. Ensure Suspense works correctly with nested server components and parallel data fetching. Test various network conditions to verify the loading states behave as expected.

## 4. Refactor existing components to use server-side data fetching [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Convert client components to server components where appropriate and update data fetching patterns
### Details:
Identify components that can be converted to server components. Refactor these components to use the new server-side data fetching utilities. Update component props and interfaces as needed. Ensure proper separation between server and client components. Test each refactored component to verify functionality remains intact.

## 5. Optimize performance of server component data fetching [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Implement caching, prefetching, and other performance optimizations for server components
### Details:
Implement React Cache for data fetching results. Set up appropriate cache invalidation strategies. Add prefetching for anticipated user interactions. Measure and optimize server component rendering performance. Implement waterfall prevention techniques for parallel data fetching. Document performance improvements and best practices for the team.
