# Task ID: 10
# Title: Enhance Real-time Voting Animations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement advanced animations for real-time updates in vote counts and rankings.
# Details:
1. Use Framer Motion to create smooth animations for vote count changes.
2. Implement a counting animation when vote numbers increase.
3. Create a ranking change animation that moves options up or down the list.
4. Add a highlight effect for options that receive new votes.
5. Implement staggered animations when multiple updates occur simultaneously.
6. Ensure animations are performant and don't cause layout shifts.
7. Add subtle loading animations while waiting for real-time updates.

# Test Strategy:
Create visual regression tests to ensure animations render correctly. Perform performance testing to verify animations don't impact page responsiveness. Test animations with various update scenarios, including rapid multiple updates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Framer Motion into Next.js 13+ App [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install Framer Motion, ensure compatibility with Next.js 13+ App Router, and set up the base configuration for client components.
### Details:
Run `npm install framer-motion`, import motion components, and verify that animations work in a minimal client component setup.

## 2. Implement Vote Count Animation [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Animate the vote count number when it changes, providing a smooth transition effect (e.g., counting up/down or scaling).
### Details:
Use Framer Motion's animate prop to smoothly update the displayed vote count. Ensure the animation triggers only on value change.

# Real-time Vote Count Animation Implementation

## Core Components
- Created `AnimatedCount` component using Framer Motion's animate prop
- Implemented smooth transitions that trigger only on value changes
- Integrated with `RealtimeVoteDetailPresenter.tsx` for complete real-time functionality

## Animation Features
- Number count animations with configurable duration and easing
- Scale and opacity transitions for vote count changes
- Timer updates with smooth animations
- Card entry/exit animations using AnimatePresence

## Integration with Real-time Data
- Connected animations to Supabase Realtime events (`vote_item_updated`, `vote_pick_created`)
- Optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders through memoization
- Added connection status indicator for better user experience

## Performance Considerations
- Animations properly clean up on component unmount
- Verified compatibility with Next.js 15
- Confirmed no SSR-related issues with animations

## 3. Create Ranking Change Animation [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Animate the movement of items when their ranking changes (e.g., list reordering with slide or fade effects).
### Details:
Leverage Framer Motion's layout animations to smoothly transition items to their new positions in the ranking list.

## Ranking Change Animation Implementation

### Implemented Features

1. **AnimatedVoteItem Component**
   - Located in `components/ui/animations/RealtimeAnimations.tsx`
   - Supports various animations for ranking changes

2. **Ranking Change Animation Types**
   - `up` - Slide from top to bottom + scale animation when rank increases
   - `down` - Slide from bottom to top + scale animation when rank decreases
   - `new` - Fade-in + scale animation from left when new item enters
   - `same` - Highlight animation when rank remains unchanged

3. **Visual Indicators**
   - Rank increase: üü¢ Green circular badge + ‚ÜóÔ∏è icon
   - Rank decrease: üî¥ Red circular badge + ‚ÜòÔ∏è icon
   - New item: üîµ Blue circular badge + üÜï icon

4. **Highlight Effects**
   - Gradient background (blue-50 to indigo-50) for changed items
   - Blue border (border-blue-200)
   - Smooth fade in/out animation

5. **RealtimeVoteDetailPresenter Integration**
   - Automatic ranking calculation on real-time data changes
   - Change detection by comparing with previous ranks in `rankedVoteItems`
   - Animations trigger automatically

### Technical Implementation
- Smooth position transitions using Framer Motion's `layout` and `layoutId`
- Entry/exit animations with `AnimatePresence`
- Spring animations (stiffness: 400-600, damping: 25-30)
- Optimized transition durations for performance

## 4. Add Highlight Effect for Updated Items [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Visually highlight items that have been updated (e.g., background color flash or glow) to draw user attention.
### Details:
Apply a temporary highlight animation using Framer Motion when an item's vote count or rank changes.

## 5. Implement Staggered Animation for Batch Updates [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: When multiple items update simultaneously, animate their changes in a staggered sequence for better visual clarity.
### Details:
Use Framer Motion's staggerChildren and variants to control the timing of animations for each item in the list.

## 6. Optimize Animation Performance [done]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Profile and optimize the animation logic to ensure smooth performance, especially during rapid or large-scale updates.
### Details:
Minimize unnecessary re-renders, use React.memo where appropriate, and test on various devices for consistent frame rates.

## 7. Add Loading Animation for Data Fetching [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Display an engaging loading animation while vote or ranking data is being fetched or updated.
### Details:
Implement a Framer Motion-based loading spinner or skeleton UI that appears during asynchronous operations.
