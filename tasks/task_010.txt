# Task ID: 10
# Title: Enhance Real-time Voting Animations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement advanced animations for real-time updates in vote counts and rankings.
# Details:
1. Use Framer Motion to create smooth animations for vote count changes.
2. Implement a counting animation when vote numbers increase.
3. Create a ranking change animation that moves options up or down the list.
4. Add a highlight effect for options that receive new votes.
5. Implement staggered animations when multiple updates occur simultaneously.
6. Ensure animations are performant and don't cause layout shifts.
7. Add subtle loading animations while waiting for real-time updates.

# Test Strategy:
Create visual regression tests to ensure animations render correctly. Perform performance testing to verify animations don't impact page responsiveness. Test animations with various update scenarios, including rapid multiple updates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Framer Motion Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Framer Motion library in the project and create basic animation components
### Details:
Install Framer Motion package, configure basic motion components, and implement layout transitions using the layout prop for smooth UI transitions

## 2. Develop Vote Count Animation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create smooth animations for vote count changes
### Details:
Implement number transitions for vote counts with appropriate easing and duration (200-500ms), ensuring subtle and purposeful animations

## 3. Build Ranking Animation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop animations for items changing positions in rankings
### Details:
Use layoutId for smooth position transitions between ranks, implement proper enter/exit animations with AnimatePresence for items joining or leaving rankings

## 4. Create Highlight Effect Animation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Design and implement highlight effects for selected or changing items
### Details:
Develop subtle highlight animations using color transitions, scale effects, or glows that draw attention without overwhelming the UI

## 5. Implement Staggered Updates Animation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create staggered animation effects for multiple elements updating simultaneously
### Details:
Use Framer Motion's staggerChildren property to create cascading animations for lists or grids of elements with appropriate timing offsets

## 6. Optimize Animation Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Ensure animations run smoothly without impacting overall application performance
### Details:
Minimize DOM manipulations, use CSS transforms instead of layout properties, implement useReducedMotion hook for accessibility, and profile performance using React DevTools and Chrome Performance tab

## 7. Develop Loading Animation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create engaging loading state animations
### Details:
Implement loading indicators with looping animations, ensure they're subtle yet informative, and properly handle mounting/unmounting with AnimatePresence
