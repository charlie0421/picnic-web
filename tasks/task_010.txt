# Task ID: 10
# Title: Enhance Real-time Voting Animations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement advanced animations for real-time updates in vote counts and rankings.
# Details:
1. Use Framer Motion to create smooth animations for vote count changes.
2. Implement a counting animation when vote numbers increase.
3. Create a ranking change animation that moves options up or down the list.
4. Add a highlight effect for options that receive new votes.
5. Implement staggered animations when multiple updates occur simultaneously.
6. Ensure animations are performant and don't cause layout shifts.
7. Add subtle loading animations while waiting for real-time updates.

# Test Strategy:
Create visual regression tests to ensure animations render correctly. Perform performance testing to verify animations don't impact page responsiveness. Test animations with various update scenarios, including rapid multiple updates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Framer Motion into Next.js 13+ App [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install Framer Motion, ensure compatibility with Next.js 13+ App Router, and set up the base configuration for client components.
### Details:
Run `npm install framer-motion`, import motion components, and verify that animations work in a minimal client component setup.

## 2. Implement Vote Count Animation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Animate the vote count number when it changes, providing a smooth transition effect (e.g., counting up/down or scaling).
### Details:
Use Framer Motion's animate prop to smoothly update the displayed vote count. Ensure the animation triggers only on value change.

## 3. Create Ranking Change Animation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Animate the movement of items when their ranking changes (e.g., list reordering with slide or fade effects).
### Details:
Leverage Framer Motion's layout animations to smoothly transition items to their new positions in the ranking list.

## 4. Add Highlight Effect for Updated Items [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Visually highlight items that have been updated (e.g., background color flash or glow) to draw user attention.
### Details:
Apply a temporary highlight animation using Framer Motion when an item's vote count or rank changes.

## 5. Implement Staggered Animation for Batch Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: When multiple items update simultaneously, animate their changes in a staggered sequence for better visual clarity.
### Details:
Use Framer Motion's staggerChildren and variants to control the timing of animations for each item in the list.

## 6. Optimize Animation Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Profile and optimize the animation logic to ensure smooth performance, especially during rapid or large-scale updates.
### Details:
Minimize unnecessary re-renders, use React.memo where appropriate, and test on various devices for consistent frame rates.

## 7. Add Loading Animation for Data Fetching [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Display an engaging loading animation while vote or ranking data is being fetched or updated.
### Details:
Implement a Framer Motion-based loading spinner or skeleton UI that appears during asynchronous operations.
