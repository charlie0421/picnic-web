# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Real-time Voting Updates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up real-time subscriptions for vote updates using Supabase Realtime.
# Details:
1. Use Supabase Realtime to subscribe to changes in the votes and user_votes tables.
2. Implement a WebSocket connection in the frontend using Supabase client.
3. Update the VoteResults component to reflect real-time changes.
4. Add animations using Framer Motion for updating vote counts and rankings.
5. Implement error handling and reconnection logic for WebSocket disconnects.
6. Optimize performance by using efficient data structures for vote counting.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test environment that simulates multiple users voting simultaneously. Verify that all clients receive updates in real-time. Test WebSocket disconnection and reconnection scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Supabase Realtime Database Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure Supabase database for realtime functionality
### Details:
Enable realtime functionality in Supabase dashboard, configure database tables for realtime updates, set up appropriate security policies for realtime access, and verify configuration using Supabase documentation

## 2. Frontend WebSocket Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement WebSocket connection to Supabase Realtime service
### Details:
Initialize Supabase client with realtime capabilities, establish channel subscription with appropriate topic, implement connection status monitoring, and create basic message handling structure

## 3. VoteResults Real-time Updates Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Develop functionality to receive and process vote updates in real-time
### Details:
Subscribe to Postgres Changes for vote-related tables, implement handlers for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE events, update application state based on incoming data, and ensure proper data synchronization between server and client

## 4. Real-time Animation Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Create smooth animations for real-time data updates
### Details:
Design transition animations for vote count changes, implement debouncing for rapid updates, create visual indicators for new votes, and ensure animations perform well across different devices

## 5. Error and Reconnection Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement robust error handling and automatic reconnection logic
### Details:
Create error detection for connection issues, implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts, develop user notifications for connection status, and handle data reconciliation after reconnection

## 6. Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.4, 4.5
### Description: Optimize real-time functionality for performance and resource usage
### Details:
Implement efficient data structures for state management, optimize rendering to prevent unnecessary updates, add payload compression if needed, and monitor memory usage during extended real-time sessions

## 7. Testing and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.6
### Description: Thoroughly test real-time functionality across various scenarios
### Details:
Create automated tests for real-time events, simulate network interruptions to test reconnection, verify data consistency across multiple clients, and perform load testing to ensure system stability under high traffic
