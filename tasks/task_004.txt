# Task ID: 4
# Title: 현재 컴포넌트 구조 분석
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Analyze the current component structure to identify components that should be server components vs. client components.
# Details:
1. Review all components in the codebase
2. Identify components that primarily handle:
   - Data fetching (potential server components)
   - UI rendering without interactivity (potential server components)
   - Interactive elements (must be client components)
   - State management (must be client components)
3. Document current client-side data fetching that could be moved to server components
4. Identify components with mixed responsibilities that should be split
5. Create a migration plan for each component

Implementation approach:
- Create a spreadsheet or document listing all components
- Categorize each component as 'Server', 'Client', or 'Split needed'
- Note dependencies between components to understand migration impact

# Test Strategy:
This is an analysis task, so formal testing is not applicable. Success criteria will be a comprehensive component inventory with clear categorization and migration recommendations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Component Inventory [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Catalog all existing components in the application with their current rendering type, functionality, and usage patterns.
### Details:
Create a spreadsheet or document listing all components with columns for: component name, current rendering type (client/server/hybrid), primary functionality, where it's used in the application, and any special requirements (e.g., needs user interaction, relies on browser APIs, etc.). Include component file paths for easy reference.

## 2. Server vs. Client Component Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Analyze each component to determine optimal rendering strategy (server or client component) based on its functionality and requirements.
### Details:
For each component in the inventory, evaluate: Does it need interactivity? Does it use browser-only APIs? Does it use hooks? Does it need access to request-time data? Mark each component with a recommended rendering strategy and document the reasoning. Flag components that may need to be split into server/client parts.

## 3. Dependency Mapping [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Create a visual dependency map showing relationships between components and identify potential issues in the current structure.
### Details:
Generate a directed graph showing component dependencies. Identify circular dependencies, client components importing server components, and other architectural issues. Document potential refactoring needs based on Next.js server/client component rules. Use a tool like Mermaid or draw.io for visualization.

## 4. Migration Planning [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Develop a phased migration plan for transitioning components to their optimal rendering strategy with minimal disruption.
### Details:
Create a prioritized list of components to migrate, starting with leaf components and working up the tree. Document required changes for each component, including: file renaming (.js/.jsx to .server.js/.client.js), code splitting needs, prop adjustments, and potential performance impacts. Include testing strategies for each migration phase.
