# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Voting System Frontend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create React components for the voting system, including vote selection, submission, and result display.
# Details:
1. Create the following React components:
   - VoteList: Displays all available votes
   - VoteItem: Individual vote item with options
   - VoteSubmit: Form for submitting a vote
   - VoteResults: Displays real-time vote results
2. Use Zustand for state management of votes and user selections.
3. Implement form validation to ensure one option is selected before submission.
4. Use Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion for animations.
5. Integrate with Supabase client to fetch and submit vote data.
