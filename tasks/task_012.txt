# Task ID: 12
# Title: Optimize Application Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement performance optimizations including code splitting, lazy loading, and caching strategies.
# Details:
1. Implement code splitting using Next.js dynamic imports for large components.
2. Set up lazy loading for images and components below the fold.
3. Optimize Tailwind CSS by purging unused styles in production builds.
4. Implement caching strategies for API responses using SWR or React Query.
5. Use Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for semi-static pages.
6. Optimize fonts by using next/font for better loading performance.
7. Implement service worker for offline support and faster subsequent page loads.
8. Use React.memo and useMemo to optimize expensive computations and rerenders.

# Test Strategy:
Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest for performance benchmarking. Create performance budgets and automated tests to prevent performance regressions. Test the application performance on various devices and network conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Code Splitting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Break the application into smaller code chunks using dynamic import() and React.lazy, focusing on route-based and component-based splitting.
### Details:
Identify large routes and components, refactor imports to use React.lazy and Suspense, and ensure proper chunk naming for maintainability.

## 2. Set Up Lazy Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Configure lazy loading for non-critical components and routes to defer their loading until needed.
### Details:
Use Suspense fallbacks for user experience, and selectively lazy load secondary features or rarely used components.

## 3. Optimize Tailwind CSS [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Tailwind CSS to purge unused styles and minimize the final CSS bundle size.
### Details:
Adjust tailwind.config.js to enable purging, review class usage, and test the build output for unnecessary CSS.

## 4. Implement API Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Introduce caching strategies for API requests to reduce redundant network calls and improve perceived performance.
### Details:
Evaluate client-side (e.g., SWR, React Query) and server-side caching options, and implement cache invalidation policies.

## 5. Configure Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up ISR to allow static pages to be updated after deployment without a full rebuild.
### Details:
Adjust framework configuration (e.g., Next.js getStaticProps with revalidate) to enable on-demand static regeneration.

## 6. Optimize Font Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve font loading performance by using modern formats, preloading, and minimizing unused font variants.
### Details:
Use font-display: swap, preload critical fonts, and remove unnecessary font weights/styles from the build.

## 7. Implement Service Worker [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add a service worker to enable offline support and advanced caching strategies for static assets and API responses.
### Details:
Register a service worker, define caching rules, and test offline behavior and cache updates.

## 8. Tune React Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Profile and optimize React components for rendering efficiency and minimal re-renders.
### Details:
Use React DevTools to identify bottlenecks, apply memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback), and optimize context usage.
