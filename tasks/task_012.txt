# Task ID: 12
# Title: 컴포넌트 테스트 작성
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create tests for key UI components to ensure they render correctly and handle user interactions properly.
# Details:
1. Identify critical UI components for testing
2. Write tests for component rendering
3. Test user interactions (clicks, form inputs, etc.)
4. Test component state changes

Example test implementation:
```typescript
// src/components/PostCard.test.tsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'
import PostCard from './PostCard'

const mockPost = {
  id: 1,
  title: 'Test Post',
  excerpt: 'This is a test post',
  slug: 'test-post',
}

describe('PostCard', () => {
  it('renders post information correctly', () => {
    render(<PostCard post={mockPost} />)
    
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Post')).toBeInTheDocument()
    expect(screen.getByText('This is a test post')).toBeInTheDocument()
    expect(screen.getByRole('link')).toHaveAttribute('href', '/blog/test-post')
  })

  it('navigates to post page when clicked', () => {
    render(<PostCard post={mockPost} />)
    
    const link = screen.getByRole('link')
    fireEvent.click(link)
    
    // Test navigation would go here if using a router mock
  })
})
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test that components render with different props
2. Verify user interactions trigger expected behaviors
3. Test loading, error, and success states
4. Test accessibility features

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Rendering Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create tests to verify components render correctly with different props and in different states
### Details:
Write tests that check if components render without errors, display the correct content based on props, handle conditional rendering correctly, and render child components as expected. Use snapshot testing where appropriate to detect unexpected UI changes.

## 2. Develop Interaction Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create tests for user interactions like clicks, inputs, and form submissions
### Details:
Simulate user events (clicks, typing, etc.) and verify components respond correctly. Test form validations, button click handlers, hover states, and other interactive elements. Use testing libraries to mock user interactions and verify the expected outcomes.

## 3. Implement State Management Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Test component state changes and integration with state management systems
### Details:
Verify that component state updates correctly in response to props changes and user interactions. Test integration with Redux, Context API, or other state management solutions. Ensure that components re-render appropriately when state changes and that state is maintained correctly across component lifecycle events.

## 4. Create Accessibility Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Test components for accessibility compliance and screen reader compatibility
### Details:
Verify that components meet WCAG guidelines. Test keyboard navigation, focus management, proper ARIA attributes, color contrast, and screen reader compatibility. Use accessibility testing tools to automate checks and ensure components are usable by people with disabilities.
