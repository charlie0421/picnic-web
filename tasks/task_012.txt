# Task ID: 12
# Title: Optimize Application Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement performance optimizations including code splitting, lazy loading, and caching strategies.
# Details:
1. Implement code splitting using Next.js dynamic imports for large components.
2. Set up lazy loading for images and components below the fold.
3. Optimize Tailwind CSS by purging unused styles in production builds.
4. Implement caching strategies for API responses using SWR or React Query.
5. Use Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for semi-static pages.
6. Optimize fonts by using next/font for better loading performance.
7. Implement service worker for offline support and faster subsequent page loads.
8. Use React.memo and useMemo to optimize expensive computations and rerenders.

# Test Strategy:
Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest for performance benchmarking. Create performance budgets and automated tests to prevent performance regressions. Test the application performance on various devices and network conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current Application Structure and Performance Bottlenecks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the existing Picnic web application to identify areas for improvement in code splitting, lazy loading, Tailwind usage, API calls, ISR, font loading, service worker setup, and React performance.
### Details:
Use profiling tools and Next.js analytics to pinpoint slow-loading pages, large bundles, and inefficient rendering patterns.

## 2. Implement Code Splitting and Lazy Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Refactor the application to leverage dynamic imports and React Suspense for components and routes that are not needed on initial load.
### Details:
Use Next.js dynamic imports and ensure only critical code is loaded upfront. Apply lazy loading to images and non-critical components.

## 3. Optimize Tailwind CSS Usage [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Configure Tailwind CSS to purge unused styles and minimize the final CSS bundle size.
### Details:
Update tailwind.config.js to enable JIT mode and ensure only used classes are included in production builds.

## 4. Set Up API Caching Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement server-side and client-side caching for API requests to reduce redundant network calls and improve perceived performance.
### Details:
Use SWR or React Query for client-side caching and HTTP cache headers or Supabase edge functions for server-side caching.

## 5. Configure Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Enable ISR for pages that can benefit from static generation with periodic revalidation to balance freshness and performance.
### Details:
Update Next.js page configurations to use revalidate options and test regeneration behavior for dynamic content.

## 6. Optimize Font Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Switch to using next/font for local font hosting and configure font-display: swap to prevent layout shifts and blocking renders.
### Details:
Audit current font usage, preload critical fonts, and defer non-essential fonts as needed.

## 7. Implement Service Worker for Offline Support and Asset Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Add a service worker to cache static assets and API responses, enabling offline access and faster repeat visits.
### Details:
Use Workbox or Next.js PWA plugins to register and configure the service worker, ensuring compatibility with App Router.

## 8. Tune React and Next.js Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Apply React and Next.js best practices such as memoization, avoiding unnecessary re-renders, and optimizing component structure.
### Details:
Use React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo where appropriate; audit component tree for heavy renders; leverage Next.js built-in optimizations.
