# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Voting System Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the backend structure for the voting system using Supabase, including database schema and API endpoints.
# Details:
1. Design and implement the following tables in Supabase:
   - votes: id, title, description, start_time, end_time
   - vote_options: id, vote_id, option_text
   - user_votes: id, user_id, vote_id, vote_option_id, created_at
2. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for each table to ensure data security.
3. Create API endpoints using Supabase Functions or Edge Functions for:
   - Creating a new vote
   - Submitting a vote
   - Fetching vote results
4. Implement server-side validation to prevent duplicate voting.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each API endpoint using Jest. Test RLS policies by attempting unauthorized access. Perform integration tests to ensure proper data flow between tables.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Database Schema Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze requirements and design a normalized database schema for the voting system, including tables for users, votes, options, and results. Define primary and foreign keys, and ensure data integrity.
### Details:
Apply best practices such as using appropriate primary keys, normalization (aim for 3NF), and defining foreign key relationships to enforce referential integrity.

## 2. Table Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement the designed schema by creating the necessary tables in the database, including constraints and indexes.
### Details:
Write and execute SQL scripts to create tables as per the schema, ensuring all relationships and constraints are properly defined.

## 3. Row-Level Security (RLS) Policy Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Configure RLS policies to restrict access to voting data based on user roles and ownership.
### Details:
Define and apply RLS policies to ensure users can only access or modify their own votes and cannot view or alter others' data.

## 4. API Endpoint Development: Create Vote [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Develop the backend API endpoint to allow users to create a new vote (poll), including specifying options and settings.
### Details:
Implement endpoint logic, handle input validation, and ensure proper database interaction for vote creation.

## 5. API Endpoint Development: Submit Vote [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Develop the backend API endpoint for users to submit their vote for a specific poll.
### Details:
Implement endpoint logic to record user votes, enforce RLS, and prevent duplicate submissions.

## 6. API Endpoint Development: Fetch Results [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.5
### Description: Develop the backend API endpoint to fetch voting results, ensuring only authorized users can access aggregated data.
### Details:
Implement logic to aggregate and return results, applying RLS and any necessary permissions checks.

## 7. Server-Side Validation and Backend Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4, 2.5, 2.6
### Description: Implement server-side validation for all endpoints and conduct comprehensive backend testing to ensure correctness, security, and robustness.
### Details:
Write validation logic for input data, test all API endpoints for expected and edge cases, and verify RLS enforcement.
