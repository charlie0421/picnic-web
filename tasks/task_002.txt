# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Voting System Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the backend structure for the voting system using Supabase, including database schema and API endpoints.
# Details:
1. Design and implement the following tables in Supabase:
   - votes: id, title, description, start_time, end_time
   - vote_options: id, vote_id, option_text
   - user_votes: id, user_id, vote_id, vote_option_id, created_at
2. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for each table to ensure data security.
3. Create API endpoints using Supabase Functions or Edge Functions for:
   - Creating a new vote
   - Submitting a vote
   - Fetching vote results
4. Implement server-side validation to prevent duplicate voting.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each API endpoint using Jest. Test RLS policies by attempting unauthorized access. Perform integration tests to ensure proper data flow between tables.

# Subtasks:
## 5. API Endpoint Development: Submit Vote [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the backend API endpoint for users to submit their vote for a specific poll.
### Details:
Implement endpoint logic to record user votes, enforce RLS, and prevent duplicate submissions.

Based on log analysis:
1. Verify vote data existence before processing (PGRST116 error on vote ID 1)
2. Integrate the existing process_vote database function into the vote submission logic
   - Function signature: process_vote(p_vote_id, p_vote_item_id, p_amount, p_user_id, p_total_bonus_remain)
   - Returns: { vote_total: number }[]
3. Implement proper error handling for cases where no rows are returned
4. Ensure the API endpoint correctly passes all required parameters to the process_vote function
5. Add validation to check remaining bonus points before processing votes

## 6. API Endpoint Development: Fetch Results [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.5
### Description: Develop the backend API endpoint to fetch voting results, ensuring only authorized users can access aggregated data.
### Details:
Implement logic to aggregate and return results, applying RLS and any necessary permissions checks.

## 7. Server-Side Validation and Backend Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.5, 2.6
### Description: Implement server-side validation for all endpoints and conduct comprehensive backend testing to ensure correctness, security, and robustness.
### Details:
Write validation logic for input data, test all API endpoints for expected and edge cases, and verify RLS enforcement.
