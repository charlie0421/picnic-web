# Task ID: 8
# Title: Improve Menu Navigation Language Handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure that the current language is maintained when navigating between Reward, Media, and Vote menus.
# Details:
1. Modify the Navigation component to dynamically generate menu links based on the current language.
2. Use next-intl's Link component for language-aware navigation.
3. Implement a custom useRouter hook that wraps next-intl's useRouter and handles language persistence.
4. Update all internal links to use the custom language-aware routing.
5. Fix the issue where '/en' is forcibly appended to URLs.
6. Ensure that language changes are reflected in menu links without page reload.
7. Implement proper SEO handling for multi-language routes.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the Navigation component and custom routing hook. Perform integration tests to verify language persistence across different page navigations. Test SEO-related aspects like correct hreflang tags.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Refactor Navigation Component for Locale Awareness [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the main Navigation component to support locale-prefixed routes and dynamic language switching, ensuring all navigation links reflect the current language context.
### Details:
Move or update the Navigation component under the appropriate app/[lang] or app/[locale] directory structure as per Next.js App Router conventions. Ensure all navigation items generate URLs with the correct locale prefix (e.g., /en/about, /ko/about).

## 2. Integrate next-intl for Internationalization [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Install and configure next-intl to provide translation and locale management throughout the app, leveraging the App Router's dynamic [locale] segment.
### Details:
Set up next-intl provider at the root layout (e.g., app/[locale]/layout.tsx). Load translation messages based on the current locale and ensure the provider wraps all pages and components that require translations.

## 3. Develop Custom useRouter Hook with Locale Support [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create a custom useRouter hook that extends Next.js's router to handle locale-aware navigation, language persistence, and programmatic route changes.
### Details:
The hook should expose navigation methods that automatically include the current locale in URLs, and provide helpers for switching languages while preserving the current path.

## 4. Update Internal Links to Use Locale-Prefixed URLs [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Refactor all internal links (e.g., <Link> components, router.push calls) to use locale-prefixed paths, ensuring consistent language context across navigation.
### Details:
Audit the codebase for hardcoded paths and update them to use the custom useRouter hook or generate URLs with the current locale. Ensure all navigation actions respect the active language.

Completed updating all internal links to use LocalizedLink or useLocaleRouter.

**Updated Components:**

**Components updated with LocalizedLink:**
1. VoteCard.tsx - Vote card links
2. BannerItem.tsx - Banner links (includes external link detection logic)
3. RewardPresenter.tsx - Reward list links
4. LoginDialog.tsx - Login page links
5. app/[lang]/not-found.tsx - 404 page links
6. app/[lang]/(auth)/login/page.tsx - Login page logo link
7. app/[lang]/(mypage)/mypage/page.tsx - All mypage links
8. app/[lang]/(mypage)/notice/page.tsx - Notice list links
9. app/[lang]/(mypage)/notice/[id]/page.tsx - Notice detail links

**Components updated with useLocaleRouter:**
1. VoteListPresenter.tsx - Changed router.push to useLocaleRouter.push
2. VoteFilterSection.tsx - Using useLocaleRouter for URL parameter updates

**Components kept with external links:**
- MediaListPresenter.tsx - Maintained as is since it uses YouTube links

**Key improvements:**
- All internal navigation now maintains the current language context
- Implemented automatic external/internal link detection in BannerItem
- Applied appropriate handling based on server/client component distinction
- Resolved TypeScript errors (removed scroll option)

All internal links now automatically include language prefixes, ensuring language context is preserved during navigation.

## 5. Fix URL Handling for Dynamic and Static Routes [done]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Ensure that both dynamic and static routes correctly handle locale segments, including edge cases such as fallback routes, 404s, and redirects.
### Details:
Test and update route definitions and middleware as needed to guarantee that all URLs are correctly parsed and generated with the locale segment. Handle cases where users access non-prefixed URLs by redirecting to the appropriate locale.

# URL Handling Improvements for Dynamic and Static Routes Completed

## Key Enhancements:

### 1. Root Page Redirect (app/page.tsx)
- Implemented automatic redirection based on browser language settings
- Added fallback to default language (Korean) for unsupported languages
- Integrated Accept-Language header parsing to detect user language preferences

### 2. Middleware Enhancements (middleware.ts)
- Enabled browser language detection (localeDetection: true)
- Improved static file handling (added favicon, robots, sitemap)

- Enhanced edge case handling

### 3. Server Component Language Processing
- Created LocalizedNotFoundLink client wrapper component
- Implemented language-aware links in NotFoundState and ErrorState
- Maintained language context across server/client component boundaries

### 4. Route Structure Validation
- Verified all dynamic routes (vote/[id], rewards/[id], notice/[id]) function correctly
- Implemented not-found.tsx for each dynamic route
- Properly configured error.tsx and loading.tsx
- Ensured auth paths work correctly without language prefixes

### 5. URL Processing Improvements
- Ensured all internal links automatically include language prefixes
- Added automatic correction of invalid URL patterns
- Supported browser back/forward navigation
- Maintained SEO-friendly URL structure

All dynamic and static routes now correctly handle language context, significantly improving the user experience.

## 6. Implement Language Change Handling and Persistence [done]
### Dependencies: 8.5
### Description: Enable seamless language switching that updates the URL, reloads translations, and persists the user's language preference across sessions.
### Details:
Update the language switcher to use the custom useRouter hook for navigation. Store the selected language in cookies or localStorage to persist the preference. Ensure the app initializes with the correct locale on subsequent visits.
