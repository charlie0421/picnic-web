# Test Strategy: ✅ 완료
All navigation links now use locale-aware routing and maintain language context.

# Subtasks: All completed ✅

## 1. Refactor Navigation Component for Locale Awareness [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the main Navigation component to support locale-prefixed routes and dynamic language switching, ensuring all navigation links reflect the current language context.
### Details:
Move or update the Navigation component under the appropriate app/[lang] or app/[locale] directory structure as per Next.js App Router conventions. Ensure all navigation items generate URLs with the correct locale prefix (e.g., /en/about, /ko/about).

## 2. Integrate next-intl for Internationalization [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Install and configure next-intl to provide translation and locale management throughout the app, leveraging the App Router's dynamic [locale] segment.
### Details:
Set up next-intl provider at the root layout (e.g., app/[locale]/layout.tsx). Load translation messages based on the current locale and ensure the provider wraps all pages and components that require translations.

## 3. Develop Custom useRouter Hook with Locale Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create a custom useRouter hook that extends Next.js's router to handle locale-aware navigation, language persistence, and programmatic route changes.
### Details:
The hook should expose navigation methods that automatically include the current locale in URLs, and provide helpers for switching languages while preserving the current path.

## 4. Update Internal Links to Use Locale-Prefixed URLs [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Refactor all internal links (e.g., <Link> components, router.push calls) to use locale-prefixed paths, ensuring consistent language context across navigation.
### Details:
Audit the codebase for hardcoded paths and update them to use the custom useRouter hook or generate URLs with the current locale. Ensure all navigation actions respect the active language.

## 5. Fix URL Handling for Dynamic and Static Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Ensure that both dynamic and static routes correctly handle locale segments, including edge cases such as fallback routes, 404s, and redirects.
### Details:
Test and update route definitions and middleware as needed to guarantee that all URLs are correctly parsed and generated with the locale segment. Handle cases where users access non-prefixed URLs by redirecting to the appropriate locale.

## 6. Implement Language Change Handling and Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.5
### Description: Enable seamless language switching that updates the URL, reloads translations, and persists the user's language preference across sessions.
### Details:
Update the language switcher to use the custom useRouter hook for navigation. Store the selected language in cookies or localStorage to persist the preference. Ensure the app initializes with the correct locale on subsequent visits.

## 7. Enhance SEO for Internationalized Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update SEO metadata, hreflang tags, and canonical URLs to reflect the current locale and improve search engine discoverability for all supported languages.
### Details:
Dynamically generate meta tags and hreflang links in the head of each page based on the active locale. Ensure canonical URLs include the locale segment. Test with SEO tools to verify correct indexing and language targeting.
