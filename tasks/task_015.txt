# Task ID: 15
# Title: Setup Monitoring and Analytics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring and analytics to track application performance and user behavior.
# Details:
1. Set up error tracking and logging using a service like Sentry.
2. Implement application performance monitoring (APM) using tools like New Relic or Datadog.
3. Set up real-time monitoring for Supabase database and API usage.
4. Implement user analytics tracking using a GDPR-compliant service like Plausible or Fathom.
5. Create custom events to track important user actions like voting and social shares.
6. Set up alerting for critical errors and performance thresholds.
7. Implement logging for server-side operations and background jobs.
8. Create a dashboard for visualizing key metrics and user engagement data.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all critical events are being logged correctly. Test error reporting by intentionally triggering errors in different parts of the application. Ensure that analytics respect user privacy settings and comply with GDPR.
