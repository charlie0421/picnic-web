# Task ID: 15
# Title: Setup Monitoring and Analytics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring and analytics to track application performance and user behavior.
# Details:
1. Set up error tracking and logging using a service like Sentry.
2. Implement application performance monitoring (APM) using tools like New Relic or Datadog.
3. Set up real-time monitoring for Supabase database and API usage.
4. Implement user analytics tracking using a GDPR-compliant service like Plausible or Fathom.
5. Create custom events to track important user actions like voting and social shares.
6. Set up alerting for critical errors and performance thresholds.
7. Implement logging for server-side operations and background jobs.
8. Create a dashboard for visualizing key metrics and user engagement data.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all critical events are being logged correctly. Test error reporting by intentionally triggering errors in different parts of the application. Ensure that analytics respect user privacy settings and comply with GDPR.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Error Tracking Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate an error tracking service (e.g., Sentry) with the Next.js 13+ App Router environment to capture and report runtime errors.
### Details:
Install the Sentry SDK, configure it for both client and server components, and verify error reporting in development and production.

## 2. Integrate Application Performance Monitoring (APM) [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Enable APM features in the error tracking service to monitor performance metrics such as response times, throughput, and slow transactions.
### Details:
Configure Sentry or a similar APM tool to capture performance data for both client and server routes, including custom spans for key operations.

## 3. Enable Supabase Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Set up monitoring for Supabase interactions, including database queries and authentication events.
### Details:
Integrate Supabase Sentry plugin or equivalent, ensure database queries and auth events are tracked, and test with sample queries.

## 4. Integrate Analytics Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add a web analytics service (e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible) to track user behavior and page views.
### Details:
Install the analytics SDK, configure it for Next.js App Router, and verify that page views and navigation events are tracked.

## 5. Implement Custom Event Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Define and implement tracking for custom events relevant to Picnic's business logic (e.g., WeChat login success, key user actions).
### Details:
Identify key events, add tracking calls in the codebase, and ensure events are sent to the analytics service.

## 6. Set Up Alerting for Critical Events [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3, 15.5
### Description: Configure alerting rules in error tracking, APM, and analytics services for critical errors, performance regressions, and business events.
### Details:
Define thresholds, set up notification channels (e.g., email, Slack), and test alert delivery.

## 7. Implement Server-Side Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.3
### Description: Establish structured server-side logging for Next.js API routes and Supabase interactions.
### Details:
Choose a logging library, standardize log formats, and ensure logs are stored and accessible for debugging.

## 8. Create Unified Monitoring Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6, 15.7
### Description: Build or configure a dashboard that aggregates error, performance, analytics, and Supabase monitoring data for real-time visibility.
### Details:
Use built-in dashboards from integrated services or create a custom dashboard using a tool like Grafana or Datadog.
