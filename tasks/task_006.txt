# Task ID: 6
# Title: Enhance Area Filter Functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add an 'All' option to the Area filter and implement state persistence using localStorage.
# Details:
1. Modify the AreaFilter component to include an 'All' option.
2. Update the Zustand store to handle the 'All' filter state.
3. Implement localStorage saving and retrieval for the selected area filter.
4. Add logic to apply the 'All' filter to the data fetching queries.
5. Ensure the filter state is restored on page refresh.
6. Update the UI to reflect the current filter state, including the 'All' option.
7. Implement internationalization for the 'All' option text.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the AreaFilter component and its integration with Zustand. Test localStorage persistence across page reloads. Verify that the 'All' filter correctly displays all items.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update AreaFilter UI Components [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Redesign and implement the AreaFilter UI to match new requirements, ensuring compatibility with Next.js 13+ App Router and Tailwind CSS.
### Details:
Refactor or create new AreaFilter components, update layout and styles using Tailwind CSS, and ensure accessibility and responsiveness.

## 2. Refactor Zustand Store for AreaFilter State [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Modify or create Zustand store slices to manage AreaFilter state, following best practices for modularity and selective subscriptions.
### Details:
Define AreaFilter state structure, actions for updating/filtering, and ensure TypeScript types are accurate. Use modular store organization and memoized selectors.

Note: The Zustand store already supports localStorage persistence through the persist middleware. The selected status and area values are being saved under the 'vote-filter-storage' key, so no additional implementation work is required for this persistence functionality.

## 3. Integrate localStorage Persistence with Zustand [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement middleware or logic to persist AreaFilter state to localStorage and rehydrate on app load.
### Details:
Use Zustand middleware or custom logic to sync AreaFilter state with localStorage, ensuring state is restored on reload and compatible with SSR.

## 4. Update Query Logic to Use AreaFilter State [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Refactor data-fetching/query logic to utilize the AreaFilter state from Zustand, ensuring correct filtering of data.
### Details:
Update Supabase or other data-fetching hooks to read AreaFilter state from the store and apply filters to queries.

## 5. Ensure UI Reflects AreaFilter State Changes [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.4
### Description: Bind AreaFilter UI components to Zustand store so that UI updates immediately reflect state changes and vice versa.
### Details:
Connect UI components to Zustand selectors, ensure two-way binding, and test for correct reactivity and minimal re-renders.

## 6. Add Internationalization Support for AreaFilter [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Integrate i18n for all AreaFilter UI text and messages, ensuring compatibility with existing localization setup.
### Details:
Extract all user-facing strings, add translation keys, and update components to use the i18n library (e.g., next-i18next or similar).
