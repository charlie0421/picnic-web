# Task ID: 13
# Title: Enhance Security Measures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement additional security features to protect user data and prevent common vulnerabilities.
# Details:
1. Implement proper CORS settings in Supabase to restrict API access.
2. Set up Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent XSS attacks.
3. Use HttpOnly cookies for storing authentication tokens.
4. Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
5. Use Supabase RLS policies to ensure data access is properly restricted.
6. Implement input sanitization on both frontend and backend.
7. Set up security headers including X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.
8. Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
9. Implement two-factor authentication option for user accounts.

# Test Strategy:
Perform security audits using tools like OWASP ZAP. Conduct penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities. Write unit tests for security-related functions like input sanitization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up strict CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks by restricting which resources can be loaded and from where.
### Details:
Configure CSP using HTTP response headers (preferred over meta tags). Include directives for script-src, style-src, and other resource types. Consider implementing a nonce-based approach for dynamic scripts. Ensure headers are sent with all HTTP responses, not just the index page.

## 2. Configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement proper CORS policies to control which domains can access your resources.
### Details:
Set up Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers with specific allowed domains rather than wildcards. Configure appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers. Test CORS configuration with cross-domain requests to ensure proper functionality.

## 3. Implement HttpOnly Cookies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure cookies with HttpOnly flag to prevent client-side script access to sensitive cookie data.
### Details:
Modify all authentication and session cookies to include the HttpOnly flag. Add Secure flag to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS. Consider implementing SameSite attribute to prevent CSRF attacks. Test cookie configuration to verify proper settings.

## 4. Set Up Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks and API abuse.
### Details:
Choose appropriate rate limiting strategy (fixed window, sliding window, or token bucket). Configure limits for authentication endpoints, API calls, and other sensitive operations. Implement proper response headers (Retry-After) for rate-limited requests. Set up monitoring for rate limit events.

## 5. Configure Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement database RLS policies to restrict data access based on user context.
### Details:
Identify tables requiring row-level security. Create RLS policies based on user roles and permissions. Test policies thoroughly to ensure proper data access control. Document RLS implementation for future maintenance.

## 6. Implement Input Sanitization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add robust input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
### Details:
Identify all user input points in the application. Implement server-side validation for all inputs. Use appropriate sanitization libraries for different input types (HTML, SQL, etc.). Create test cases to verify sanitization effectiveness against common attack vectors.

## 7. Configure Additional Security Headers [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Implement security headers beyond CSP to enhance application security posture.
### Details:
Configure X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, and Strict-Transport-Security headers. Consider implementing Feature-Policy/Permissions-Policy headers. Test headers using security scanning tools to verify proper implementation.

## 8. Implement Dependency Update Process [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a systematic approach to identify and update vulnerable dependencies.
### Details:
Set up automated dependency scanning tools. Create a process for regular dependency reviews. Implement automated testing for dependency updates. Document the update process and establish response procedures for critical vulnerabilities.

## 9. Implement Two-Factor Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Add 2FA support to strengthen authentication security beyond passwords.
### Details:
Select appropriate 2FA methods (TOTP, SMS, email, etc.). Implement 2FA enrollment and verification flows. Create backup/recovery mechanisms for lost 2FA devices. Test the complete 2FA implementation including edge cases and recovery paths.
