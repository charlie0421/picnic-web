# Task ID: 13
# Title: Enhance Security Measures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement additional security features to protect user data and prevent common vulnerabilities.
# Details:
1. Implement proper CORS settings in Supabase to restrict API access.
2. Set up Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent XSS attacks.
3. Use HttpOnly cookies for storing authentication tokens.
4. Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
5. Use Supabase RLS policies to ensure data access is properly restricted.
6. Implement input sanitization on both frontend and backend.
7. Set up security headers including X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.
8. Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
9. Implement two-factor authentication option for user accounts.

# Test Strategy:
Perform security audits using tools like OWASP ZAP. Conduct penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities. Write unit tests for security-related functions like input sanitization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure CORS Policy in Next.js App Router [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and enforce Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules for all API endpoints and route handlers to restrict allowed origins and HTTP methods.
### Details:
Review all custom route handlers (route.ts) and API endpoints. Use appropriate CORS middleware or headers to allow only trusted origins, especially for endpoints handling authentication or sensitive data.

## 2. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and apply a strict Content Security Policy via HTTP headers to mitigate XSS and data injection attacks.
### Details:
Configure the Content-Security-Policy header in the Next.js custom server or via middleware. Specify allowed sources for scripts, styles, images, and other resources. Test the policy in development and staging environments to avoid breaking legitimate functionality.

## 3. Set HttpOnly and Secure Flags on Authentication Cookies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all authentication and session cookies are set with HttpOnly and Secure flags to prevent client-side access and transmission over insecure channels.
### Details:
Audit cookie usage in Supabase auth integration and any custom session management. Update cookie settings in API route handlers and middleware to include HttpOnly and Secure attributes.

## 4. Integrate Rate Limiting for API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply rate limiting to all public-facing API endpoints and authentication routes to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.
### Details:
Select a rate limiting middleware compatible with Next.js App Router (e.g., using edge middleware or serverless functions). Configure limits based on endpoint sensitivity and expected usage patterns.

## 5. Define and Enforce Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies in Supabase [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit and implement RLS policies for all relevant tables in Supabase to ensure users can only access their own data.
### Details:
Review current Supabase schema and authentication logic. Write and test RLS policies for each table, ensuring proper enforcement for both read and write operations.

## 6. Implement Input Sanitization and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Sanitize and validate all user input on both client and server sides to prevent injection attacks and malformed data.
### Details:
Use libraries such as zod or yup for TypeScript-based validation. Apply input checks in server actions, API routes, and Supabase queries. Ensure error handling for invalid input.

## 7. Set Additional Security Headers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add and configure security-related HTTP headers such as X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and Referrer-Policy.
### Details:
Update Next.js custom server or middleware to include these headers in all responses. Test for compatibility with frontend features and third-party integrations.

## 8. Automate Dependency Updates and Security Audits [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up automated tools to regularly check for and apply security updates to dependencies.
### Details:
Integrate tools like Dependabot or Renovate for npm packages. Schedule regular security audits using npm audit or similar tools, and review update logs for breaking changes.

## 9. Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for User Accounts [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3, 13.5
### Description: Add support for two-factor authentication in the authentication flow, leveraging Supabase or a compatible third-party provider.
### Details:
Design the 2FA flow (e.g., TOTP, SMS, or email-based). Update authentication UI and backend logic to support 2FA enrollment, verification, and recovery. Ensure compatibility with existing WeChat login integration.
