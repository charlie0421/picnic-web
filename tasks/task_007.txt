# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Status Filter Persistence
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add localStorage persistence for the Status filter selection.
# Details:
1. Modify the StatusFilter component to save selected status to localStorage.
2. Update the Zustand store to handle loading and saving of status filter state.
3. Implement a function to retrieve and apply saved status filter on page load.
4. Add a reset button to clear saved filter state.
5. Handle cases where saved filter value is no longer valid.
6. Ensure filter state is correctly applied to data queries.
7. Update UI to reflect current filter state, including saved state.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for StatusFilter component and localStorage interactions. Test filter persistence across page reloads and browser sessions. Verify that invalid saved states are handled gracefully.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update StatusFilter UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Revise the StatusFilter UI to support new status options, improved usability, and clear filter application controls.
### Details:
Modify relevant UI files (e.g., Status/index.tsx) to add or update status filter controls, ensuring alignment with design patterns and best practices for filter UX.

## 2. Implement Zustand Store Changes [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Update the Zustand store to manage the status filter state, including actions for setting, resetting, and persisting filter values.
### Details:
Add or update Zustand store slices to handle status filter state, ensuring the store can be easily integrated with the UI and supports future extensibility.

## 3. Integrate localStorage Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Enable persistence of the status filter state in localStorage to maintain user preferences across sessions.
### Details:
Implement logic to save and retrieve the status filter state from localStorage, syncing with the Zustand store on app load and filter changes.

## 4. Add Reset Logic for Status Filter [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Provide a mechanism to reset the status filter to its default state, clearing both the UI and persisted state.
### Details:
Implement a reset action in the Zustand store and connect it to the UI, ensuring localStorage is also cleared or reset appropriately.

## 5. Handle Invalid or Corrupt State [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Detect and handle invalid or corrupt status filter states from localStorage or user input, ensuring robust error handling.
### Details:
Add validation logic when loading from localStorage and when updating the filter, reverting to defaults or showing user feedback if state is invalid.

## 6. Update Data Query and UI to Reflect Filter Changes [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Ensure that data queries and UI components update in real-time or on user action to reflect the current status filter selection.
### Details:
Connect the status filter state to data fetching logic and UI rendering, ensuring filtered results are displayed and updated as expected.
