# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Status Filter Persistence
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add localStorage persistence for the Status filter selection.
# Details:
1. Modify the StatusFilter component to save selected status to localStorage.
2. Update the Zustand store to handle loading and saving of status filter state.
3. Implement a function to retrieve and apply saved status filter on page load.
4. Add a reset button to clear saved filter state.
5. Handle cases where saved filter value is no longer valid.
6. Ensure filter state is correctly applied to data queries.
7. Update UI to reflect current filter state, including saved state.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for StatusFilter component and localStorage interactions. Test filter persistence across page reloads and browser sessions. Verify that invalid saved states are handled gracefully.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update StatusFilter UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Revise the StatusFilter UI to reflect new requirements, ensuring it is visually consistent with Tailwind CSS and integrates smoothly with the Next.js 13+ App Router.
### Details:
Implement new filter options, update component structure, and ensure accessibility. Prepare for interaction with Zustand store.

## 2. Refactor Zustand Store for Status State [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Modify or create a dedicated Zustand store slice for status filter state, following best practices for modularity and selective subscriptions.
### Details:
Ensure the store exposes actions for updating, resetting, and validating status filter state. Use selectors to minimize unnecessary re-renders.

## 3. Integrate localStorage Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement middleware or custom logic to persist the status filter state to localStorage and hydrate it on app load.
### Details:
Use Zustand middleware or custom hooks to sync state changes with localStorage, ensuring state is restored on refresh or navigation.

## 4. Implement Reset Logic for Status Filter [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Add logic to reset the status filter state both in the Zustand store and in localStorage, ensuring a consistent reset experience.
### Details:
Expose a reset action in the store and connect it to the UI. Ensure localStorage is cleared or reset accordingly.

## 5. Handle Invalid or Corrupt State [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Add validation and error handling for cases where the status filter state in localStorage is invalid or corrupt.
### Details:
Implement checks during hydration and provide fallback to default state if validation fails. Optionally notify the user or log errors.

## 6. Update Data Query and UI to Reflect Filter State [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Ensure that data fetching logic and UI components reactively update based on the current status filter state from the Zustand store.
### Details:
Update data queries (e.g., Supabase) to use the filter, and ensure UI components display filtered results and respond to state changes.
