Implement a higher-order component (HOC) or custom hook to check user authentication status:\n   - Create a function that verifies if the user is logged in\n   - If not logged in, trigger the \"Login Required\" dialog\n\n3. Develop a redirect mechanism:\n   - Before redirecting to the login page, store the current page URL in localStorage or a secure cookie\n   - Use Next.js routing to redirect to the login page\n\n4. Modify the login process:\n   - After successful login, check for a stored redirect URL\n   - If found, navigate the user back to the stored URL\n   - If not found, redirect to a default page (e.g., dashboard)\n\n5. Implement the logic to show the \"Login Required\" dialog:\n   - Identify all actions or pages that require authentication\n   - Before allowing access, use the authentication check HOC/hook\n   - If not authenticated, show the \"Login Required\" dialog\n\n6. Handle edge cases:\n   - Ensure the stored URL is within the application domain to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities\n   - Implement an expiration for the stored URL to avoid outdated redirects\n   - Handle cases where the stored URL is no longer valid or accessible\n\n7. Optimize for performance:\n   - Ensure the dialog appears quickly when triggered\n   - Minimize any layout shifts when the dialog is shown or hidden\n\n8. Internationalization:\n   - Ensure all text in the dialog and related messages are localized using next-intl\n\nCode example for the HOC:\n\n```typescript\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router';\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { useUser } from '@/hooks/useUser'; // Assume this hook provides user authentication status\n\nexport function withAuthCheck(WrappedComponent) {\n  return function AuthCheckedComponent(props) {\n    const router = useRouter();\n    const { user, isLoading } = useUser();\n    const [showLoginDialog, setShowLoginDialog] = useState(false);\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n      if (!isLoading && !user) {\n        setShowLoginDialog(true);\n      }\n    }, [user, isLoading]);\n\n    const handleLogin = () => {\n      localStorage.setItem('redirectUrl', router.asPath);\n      router.push('/login');\n    };\n\n    if (showLoginDialog) {\n      return (\n        <LoginRequiredDialog\n          onLogin={handleLogin}\n          onCancel={() => setShowLoginDialog(false)}\n        />\n      );\n    }\n\n    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;\n  };\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```typescript\nconst ProtectedPage = withAuthCheck(YourPageComponent);\n```",
