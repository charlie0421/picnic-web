2. Implement Cypress for end-to-end testing.
3. Create unit tests for all utility functions and hooks.
4. Write integration tests for complex component interactions.
5. Develop end-to-end tests for critical user flows like voting and authentication.
6. Implement visual regression testing using tools like Percy.
7. Set up CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically on each commit.
8. Create mocks for external services and APIs to enable isolated testing.
9. Implement test coverage reporting and set minimum coverage thresholds.
10. Develop tests for different locales to ensure proper internationalization.

# Test Strategy:
Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths. Regularly review and update tests as new features are added. Incorporate testing into the development workflow to catch issues early.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Unit Test Framework Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure and set up the unit testing framework to test individual components of code
### Details:
Select appropriate testing library (Jest, Mocha, etc.), configure test runners, set up folder structure for test files, and create initial configuration files for running unit tests

## 2. Integration Test Environment Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Establish environment for testing how different modules work together
### Details:
Set up integration test framework, configure database connections for testing, create test data fixtures, and establish environment variables for integration testing

## 3. End-to-End Test Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Build infrastructure for comprehensive system testing that validates entire application workflows
### Details:
Select and configure E2E testing tools (Cypress, Selenium, etc.), set up browser automation, create test user accounts, and establish baseline test scenarios for critical user journeys

## 4. Utility and Hook Test Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop tests for utility functions and hooks that are used across the application
### Details:
Identify all utility functions and hooks, create test cases for each function covering normal and edge cases, implement mocks for dependencies, and ensure proper error handling testing

## 5. Component Interaction Test Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.4
### Description: Create tests that verify proper interaction between connected components
### Details:
Map component relationships, develop tests for props passing, event handling, state management between components, and verify proper rendering of child components

## 6. User Flow Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Develop comprehensive test scenarios that validate complete user journeys
### Details:
Document key user flows, create test scripts for each flow, implement assertions for expected outcomes, and develop tests for alternative paths and error handling

## 7. Visual Regression Testing Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Implement system to detect unintended visual changes in the UI
### Details:
Select visual testing tools, capture baseline screenshots of UI components, configure comparison thresholds, and establish process for reviewing and approving visual changes

## 8. External Service Mock Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Create mock implementations for all external services and APIs
### Details:
Identify all external dependencies, create mock responses for each API endpoint, simulate various response scenarios including errors, and ensure mocks can be toggled for different test environments

## 9. CI/CD Pipeline Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.7
### Description: Integrate all testing suites into the continuous integration and deployment pipeline
### Details:
Configure test runs in CI/CD platform, set up test reporting, establish quality gates based on test results, and optimize test execution for pipeline performance

## 10. Test Coverage Reporting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.9
### Description: Implement comprehensive test coverage reporting across all test types
### Details:
