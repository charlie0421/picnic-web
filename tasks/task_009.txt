# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Initial Language Detection and Persistence
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Detect the user's preferred language on first visit and persist language selection.
# Details:
1. Create a utility function to detect browser language using navigator.language.
2. Implement mapping of detected language to supported languages (ko, en).
3. Use localStorage to save and retrieve the user's language preference.
4. Modify _app.js to apply the detected or saved language on initial load.
5. Update the language switcher component to save changes to localStorage.
6. Ensure that saved language preference takes precedence over detected language.
7. Implement a fallback to default language if detected/saved language is not supported.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for language detection and mapping functions. Test persistence of language selection across page reloads and new sessions. Verify correct fallback behavior for unsupported languages.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Language Detection Utility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a utility function or module that can detect the language of a given text input using appropriate libraries or APIs.
### Details:
Choose a language detection approach (e.g., using NLP libraries or external APIs), implement the detection logic, and ensure it returns standardized language codes.

## 2. Create Language Mapping Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Establish a mapping between detected language codes and the application's supported languages/locales.
### Details:
Define a mapping object or function that translates detected language codes to the app's internal language keys, handling unsupported or ambiguous codes.

## 3. Integrate localStorage for Language Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement logic to store and retrieve the user's language preference in localStorage.
### Details:
Ensure that language selection and detection results are saved to localStorage and retrieved on subsequent visits to persist user preference.

## 4. Modify _app.js for Language Initialization [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Update the _app.js file to initialize the app's language based on precedence logic, including detection, mapping, and localStorage.
### Details:
Ensure _app.js checks localStorage, then browser settings, then detection utility, and finally falls back to a default language if needed.

## 5. Update Language Switcher Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Refactor the language switcher UI to interact with the new language logic and update localStorage on user selection.
### Details:
Ensure the switcher updates the app's language, persists the choice, and triggers re-rendering as needed.

## 6. Implement Language Precedence Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Define and enforce the order of precedence for language selection: localStorage > browser settings > detection > fallback.
### Details:
Centralize the logic to determine which language should be used at app startup and after user actions.

## 7. Handle Fallback Language Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure robust fallback handling when detection fails or an unsupported language is encountered.
### Details:
Implement logic to default to a safe language (e.g., English) and provide user feedback if necessary.
