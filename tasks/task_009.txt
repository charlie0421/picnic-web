# Title: Implement Initial Language Detection and Persistence
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Detect the user's preferred language on first visit and persist language selection.
# Details:
언어 감지 및 지속성 시스템이 완료되었습니다:
- utils/language-detection.ts: 종합적인 언어 감지 시스템 구현
- 브라우저 언어, localStorage, 쿠키에서 언어 감지
- 지역별 언어 매핑 (zh-cn→zh, en-us→en, ko-kr→ko 등)
- LanguageSyncProvider: 스마트 언어 감지 및 초기화 시스템
- LanguageSelector: 접근성 및 언어 지속성 개선
- 우선순위 기반 감지: URL → localStorage → 쿠키 → 브라우저 → 기본값

# Test Strategy: ✅ 완료
Smart language detection with multi-source persistence working across all browsers.

# Subtasks: All completed ✅

## 1. Implement Language Detection Utility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a utility function to detect the user's preferred language using sources such as the Accept-Language header, browser settings, or cookies.
### Details:
This utility should prioritize detection methods and return a standardized locale string compatible with the app's supported languages.

## 2. Create Language Mapping Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Map detected language codes to supported locales, handling cases where only a region or script differs, and provide fallbacks as needed.
### Details:
Ensure that if a detected locale is not directly supported, the mapping logic falls back to a more general or default locale as per Next.js i18n best practices.

## 3. Integrate localStorage for Language Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement logic to store and retrieve the user's language preference in localStorage to persist their choice across sessions.
### Details:
Ensure that the language preference is read from localStorage on app load and updated whenever the user changes their language.

## 4. Modify _app.js for Language Initialization [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Update the custom _app.js (or equivalent in App Router) to initialize the app's language based on detection, mapping, and localStorage.
### Details:
Ensure the app wraps all pages/components with the necessary i18n providers and initializes the language state correctly.

## 5. Update Language Switcher Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Refactor the language switcher UI to interact with the new language detection and persistence logic, updating both state and localStorage.
### Details:
The switcher should allow users to change languages, update the app's locale, and persist the choice.

## 6. Implement Language Precedence Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Define and implement the order of precedence for language selection: localStorage, URL, browser settings, and default fallback.
### Details:
Ensure the app consistently applies this precedence when determining which language to display.

## 7. Handle Fallbacks and Edge Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement robust fallback handling for unsupported or missing locales, ensuring the app gracefully defaults to the primary language.
### Details:
Test edge cases such as unsupported browser languages, missing translation files, and ensure the user experience remains consistent.
