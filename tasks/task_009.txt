# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Initial Language Detection and Persistence
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Detect the user's preferred language on first visit and persist language selection.
# Details:
1. Create a utility function to detect browser language using navigator.language.
2. Implement mapping of detected language to supported languages (ko, en).
3. Use localStorage to save and retrieve the user's language preference.
4. Modify _app.js to apply the detected or saved language on initial load.
5. Update the language switcher component to save changes to localStorage.
6. Ensure that saved language preference takes precedence over detected language.
7. Implement a fallback to default language if detected/saved language is not supported.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for language detection and mapping functions. Test persistence of language selection across page reloads and new sessions. Verify correct fallback behavior for unsupported languages.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Language Detection Utility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a utility function to detect the user's preferred language using sources such as the Accept-Language header, browser settings, or cookies.
### Details:
This utility should prioritize detection methods and return a standardized locale string compatible with the app's supported languages.

## 2. Create Language Mapping Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Map detected language codes to supported locales, handling cases where only a region or script differs, and provide fallbacks as needed.
### Details:
Ensure that if a detected locale is not directly supported, the mapping logic falls back to a more general or default locale as per Next.js i18n best practices.

## 3. Integrate localStorage for Language Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement logic to store and retrieve the user's language preference in localStorage to persist their choice across sessions.
### Details:
Ensure that the language preference is read from localStorage on app load and updated whenever the user changes their language.

## 4. Modify _app.js for Language Initialization [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Update the custom _app.js (or equivalent in App Router) to initialize the app's language based on detection, mapping, and localStorage.
### Details:
Ensure the app wraps all pages/components with the necessary i18n providers and initializes the language state correctly.

## 5. Update Language Switcher Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Refactor the language switcher UI to interact with the new language detection and persistence logic, updating both state and localStorage.
### Details:
The switcher should allow users to change languages, update the app's locale, and persist the choice.

## 6. Implement Language Precedence Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Define and implement the order of precedence for language selection: localStorage, URL, browser settings, and default fallback.
### Details:
Ensure the app consistently applies this precedence when determining which language to display.

## 7. Handle Fallbacks and Edge Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement robust fallback handling for unsupported or missing locales, ensuring the app gracefully defaults to the primary language.
### Details:
Test edge cases such as unsupported browser languages, missing translation files, and ensure the user experience remains consistent.
