			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Documentation and Knowledge Transfer",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the documentation and knowledge transfer task into specific subtasks for creating architecture documentation, updating existing docs, preparing code examples, conducting training sessions, and creating a troubleshooting guide.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating comprehensive documentation and conducting knowledge transfer, which requires a deep understanding of the new architecture and the ability to effectively communicate complex concepts. The multiple components of documentation and the need for interactive sessions increase its complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Audit and Document Current Supabase Usage",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Supabase usage audit into subtasks for setting up tracking tools, performing the codebase search, analyzing and categorizing usage patterns, and creating a final audit report with visualizations.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires a thorough analysis of the entire codebase and a deep understanding of Supabase integration patterns. The complexity is high due to the need for comprehensive documentation and the potential for discovering intricate usage patterns across the application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Create Server-Side Supabase Client Utility",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the server-side Supabase client utility creation into subtasks for implementing the core client, adding error handling and logging, and creating helper methods for common operations.",
			"reasoning": "While this task involves creating a crucial utility, the implementation is relatively straightforward given the provided code example. The complexity comes from ensuring proper error handling, logging, and creating a robust interface for other parts of the application to use."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Data Access API Routes",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the implementation of data access API routes into subtasks for each CRUD operation type, plus additional tasks for implementing authentication middleware, error handling, and query parameter processing.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the need to implement multiple API routes covering all CRUD operations, ensuring proper authentication, handling various query parameters, and maintaining consistency across all endpoints. It requires a deep understanding of both the application's data model and RESTful API design principles."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Update Environment Variables",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the environment variable update task into subtasks for removing client-side variables, configuring server-side variables, and updating deployment configurations for different environments.",
			"reasoning": "While this task is crucial for security, its complexity is moderate. The main challenges are ensuring all environments are correctly updated and that no client-side code is left referencing removed variables. Careful coordination with deployment processes is necessary."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Design API Route Structure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the API route structure design task into subtasks for analyzing current data access patterns, designing the route hierarchy, documenting request/response formats, and creating a mapping between old Supabase calls and new API routes.",
			"reasoning": "Designing a comprehensive API structure requires a holistic view of the application's data flow and user interactions. The complexity is high due to the need to ensure the new structure efficiently replaces all existing Supabase operations while following RESTful best practices and considering future scalability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Testing",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the comprehensive testing implementation into subtasks for creating unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, performance tests, and a final test execution and reporting phase.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a comprehensive testing strategy across multiple levels of the application is a complex task. It requires deep knowledge of testing methodologies, the ability to simulate various scenarios, and ensure coverage across the entire refactored architecture. The high complexity is due to the breadth and depth of testing required."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Update Client Components",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the client component update task into subtasks for refactoring data fetching logic, updating state management, implementing error handling for API requests, and updating realtime functionality in components.",
			"reasoning": "Refactoring client components involves touching multiple parts of the frontend codebase. The complexity arises from ensuring all Supabase calls are replaced with appropriate API calls, handling potential changes in data structure or timing, and maintaining or improving the current functionality and user experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Realtime Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the realtime functionality implementation into subtasks for designing the server-side event handling, implementing client-side event listeners, creating secure token generation for client access, and testing realtime communication flows.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing realtime functionality is complex due to the need to manage server-side subscriptions, ensure efficient event delivery, and maintain security. The task requires careful consideration of scalability and potential race conditions, as well as implementing fallback mechanisms for connection issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Authentication API Routes",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task with a focus on implement authentication api routes.",
			"reasoning": "Automatically added due to missing analysis in AI response."
